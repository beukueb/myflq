Input options
 - *Negative reads filter*   
   Working with a ROI, immplies the possibility of having flanks that overlap in certain reads, therefore implying a negative ROI-length. With this option activated they are annotated in the locus stats, else they are represented as '[-]' together with the other allele candidates.
 - *Cluster information*  
   With this option activated, unique reads within a locus are compared to each other. Reads that differ little are annotated as such. Does require more processing time.
